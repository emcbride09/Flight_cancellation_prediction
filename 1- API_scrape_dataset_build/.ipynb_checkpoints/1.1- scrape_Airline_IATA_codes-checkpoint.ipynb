    "Do the airlines report the exact cause of the delay?\n",
    "The airlines report the causes of delay in broad categories that were created by the Air Carrier On-Time Reporting Advisory Committee.  The categories are Air Carrier, National Aviation System, Weather, Late-Arriving Aircraft and Security.  The causes of cancellation are the same, except there is no late-arriving aircraft category.\n",
    "\n",
    "How are these categories defined?\n",
    "\n",
    "Air Carrier: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).\n",
    "Extreme Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.\n",
    "National Aviation System (NAS): Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.\n",
    "Late-arriving aircraft: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.\n",
    "Security: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.\n",
